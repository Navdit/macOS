    retention-policy = ""
    bind-address = ":2003"
    protocol = "tcp"
    consistency-level = "one"
    batch-size = 5000
    batch-pending = 10
    batch-timeout = "1s"
    udp-read-buffer = 0
    separator = "."
    
 6. Stopping Influx DB
    * install brew services by tapping homebrew/services
